\section{Conclusions}

After all that work, what have you found out?


The thesis created by this \LaTeX\/ class  should meet the requirements of the
Graduate School.  However, before you print it,  ask them to review it for style
with enough lead time to make changes as needed. The class file you are using
was written in January 2018 to match a style manual dating from 2015.  The
output will have some characteristics of the \LaTeX\/ system that may seem odd
to someone used to processing with Microsoft Word.  Making global changes in the
class file is not trivial but often a solution can be found by searching
Stackexchange or other web resources. If you encounter problems in producing the
desired format you cannot solve,  please contact Prof. Kielkopf in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy.  If you find something you think should be
shared with other students  writing dissertations, also please let me know so
that it can be added.
